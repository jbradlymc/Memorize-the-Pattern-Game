-To start the game: use Button5 and Button6 to increment and decrement the number of patterns to be generated.
-The Common Cathode 7-segment display (SSD) shows the number of patterns to be generated
-Click Button4 to start, so the 4-pin LED RGB will light red green and blue colors in random pattern that needs to be memorized by the user in the right order
-Once the RGB is done in doing the pattern, the SSD will light up to show 3 (maximum lives the player has)
-The player will then use the 3 buttons (Button1, Button2, Button3) connected to each individual LEDS colored Red, Green and Blue to repeat the pattern generated by the RGB
-If the player clicked the button that is not the correct pattern, the number in the SSD will become 2, until it reaches 0 if the user is always wrong. After reaching 0, the game will reset into the increment and decrement phase again in selecting the number of random pattern to be generated.
-On the other hand, if the player is correct for all the pattern, the RGB will generate a new pattern different than the first one but the speed on how it is shown is now faster and the cycle will just repeat and becomes faster and faster
-The game will continue as is as long as life of the player is not 0
